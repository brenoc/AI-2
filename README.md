## Instructions

The project instructions are located at [ENUNCIADO.pdf](ENUNCIADO.pdf).

## Project Structure

The project is separated in three main applications:

 * **Map Generator**: generates a random map in a pre-determined format, following the specifications set by the instructions. Implemented in *any language*.

 * **Path Generator**: reads the map and uses logic to walk through the forest, while facing enemies, gathering valuables, and (hopefully) achieving the objective. Implemented in *Prolog*.

 * **Path Illustrator**: reads the map and path that were generated and draws the forest, illustrating the hero's journey. Implemented in *web technologies*.
